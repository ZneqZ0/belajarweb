  <p>
    In the 33,550,335th story, I'm still searching for that answer.

In one story, the blonde weaver gave up her work as a tailor to become a free-spirited bandit alongside her cat.
In another story, the lion-like prince grew up strong and healthy, remaining undefeated with not a single scar left on his body.
And sometimes, the red-haired girls would find protection under a kind ruler, filling Okhema with their laughter and joy.
I've also seen the songstress of the Ocean return to the uninhabited shore with the Imperator, while Anaxagoras took up the mantle as the head of the Flame-Chase, leading everyone forward...

But at the end of every story, like pages burning in vain, a pitch-black monster emerges.
You say it has many names.
"Irontomb," "Destruction," or... "Destiny."

Peach, you're always smiling, but I can feel every tremor in your voice when you tell the story.
Is that how the Flame-Chase ends?
Every story writes that "Losses are a constant on the Flame-Chase journey."
You say that's also "love."
So, is "love" a series of losses, and also a series of waiting?

If you run toward it, you might fall and shatter into countless pieces.
Heh, but from a different perspective, those fragments are like crystal flowers, reflecting even more beautiful eyes, right?

In this story, ripples will spread for the shooting star... The flower nourished through thirty million lifetimes will finally drift into the distance.
I know that soon, I'll lose many memories, like petals falling one by one. But only then can I become light enough to ride on the wind and chase after the shooting star ♪

Then, let me be the little fairy in Peach's story~ I'll dress myself up in pink fluff. In my most adorable form, I'll accept every request from "Cyrene" and plant crystal flowers of "love" in people's hearts.

Then, in the name of "Cyrene," together with the shooting star, let's write a romantic story like none that has come before ♪

—— "Cyrene's" Memory
